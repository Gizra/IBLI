    Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) is a product that is designed to protect pastoralists against drought-related livestock mortality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike traditional insurance, which makes a payout based on case-by-case assessments of individual clientsâ€™ loss realizations, index-based insurance pays policyholders based on an external indicator that triggers payment to all insured clients within a geographically-defined area.
  </p>
  <p>
    I Based on satellite data, known as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that provides estimated forage availability, the IBLI product being implemented in Kenya pays out when forage scarcity is predicted to have caused livestock deaths in an area.
