  Since 2010, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and its partners, has been involved in designing, implementing, and assessing Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia. IBLI’s objective is to improve pastoralists’ resilience to the considerable loss of livestock they incur during severe drought.

<p>
  This web platform aims to improve access to important information regarding IBLI such as the current condition of livestock in target areas as per the index that underlies IBLI, historical index readings, other relevant parameters of IBLI performance and general IBLI-related information. Automating these  processes allows for near-real time information dissemination. Whether you are a pastoralist, an insurer, a government representative, or just an interested party, we welcome you and trust that herein you will find answers to most of the questions you have regarding the IBLI Program.
